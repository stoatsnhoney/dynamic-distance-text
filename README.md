# Add Frame Range Presets Add-On for Blender
A simple Blender add-on that adds a panel to the Output Properties tab. You can create preset frame ranges from this panel and even make automatic presets from existing markers.

# How to Use
After installing, you will find a new panel in the Output Properties tab. You can save the current frame range as a preset or automatically generate presets from existing markers on the timeline. The last marker's preset defaults to a range of 100 frames. You can adjust this to your liking in add-on preferences.
