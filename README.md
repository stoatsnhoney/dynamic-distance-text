# Dynamic Distance Text add-on for Blender
Dynamic Distance Text lets you dynamically adjust a text object to display the distance to a target object. Useful for HUDs or UIs.

# How to Use
After installing, you will find a new panel in the text Object Data tab. You click on your desired text, add a target object in the new panel, and the text will now display as the distance in meters to the target object. You can adjust the scale of the displayed distance, and bake it to an animation.
